        "# Assignment 0 Part 2 - Vision Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a significant shift in the field of computer vision, building on the transformative success of Transformers in natural language processing (NLP). The concept of Transformers was first introduced in the seminal 2017 paper, \"Attention is All You Need,\" which revolutionized machine translation and other NLP tasks by employing self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of text. Inspired by this success, researchers have recently extended the Transformer architecture to the domain of computer vision, giving rise to Vision Transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely heavily on convolutions and leverage spatial invariance to process images, Vision Transformers take a different approach. Instead of treating an image as a grid of pixels, ViTs divide the image into a sequence of smaller patches, each of which is treated as a tokenâ€”analogous to words in a sentence. These patches are then processed by the Transformer architecture, enabling the model to capture relationships between different parts of the image without relying on convolutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of this architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different patches relative to each other, effectively modeling the dependencies between various regions of the image. This mechanism is remarkably similar to the self-attention used in language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures designed for text, demonstrating the versatility and power of the Transformer framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key advantages of Vision Transformers is their compatibility with transfer learning. Transfer learning allows you to leverage pretrained weights from a model trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, and adapt them to your specific task. This can significantly reduce the time and computational resources required, as you don't need to train a model from scratch. In this assignment, you'll explore how to load a pretrained Vision Transformer model and copy over the weights, enabling you to benefit from the knowledge encoded in the original model. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with one of the most exciting innovations in computer vision today, highlighting both the power of Transformers and the utility of transfer learning.\n",

        "For example, an image of size 224x224 pixels can be divided into 16x16 patches, resulting in a grid of 14x14 patches. Each patch is then embedded into a vector using a convolutional layer, which extracts features like edges, textures, and colors. This transformation effectively turns a 2D image into a 1D sequence of patches, where each patch contains a small portion of the image's data. These patch embeddings are treated as tokens in a sequence, and are fed into the Transformer model, which applies self-attention to learn relationships between different parts of the image.\n",

The kernel, also known as the filter, slides across the image, covering different sections, or patches, of the input. At each position, the kernel performs a dot product between the filter weights and the corresponding input pixels, followed by summing these products and applying an activation function. The output from each position becomes an element in the resulting feature map."

Each Encoder Block is designed to process and refine the input sequenceâ€”here, the sequence of patch embeddings enriched with positional encodings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Encoder Block consists of two main sub-layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism: This layer allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing various relationships and dependencies among the patches. As discussed earlier, multiple heads enable the model to learn different aspects of the data, providing a comprehensive representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**: Following the self-attention layer, a position-wise feed-forward neural network processes the output. This network typically consists of two linear transformations separated by a non-linear activation function, such as GeLU. It acts on each position independently and helps in further transforming and refining the representation learned from the self-attention layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure the effective flow of gradients during training and to preserve the original input information, each sub-layer is equipped with **Skip Connections** (also known as Residual Connections). These connections add the input of each sub-layer to its output, forming a residual path that facilitates better gradient propagation and helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",

This is a very old idea in Deep Learning, going [back to 2015 with ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), and can perhaps be better understood with the following illustration:\n",

        "The output is then normalized using Layer Normalization (`LayerNorm`), which stabilizes the training by normalizing the summed outputs across each patch, ensuring that the model's activations are within a stable range. LayerNorm adjusts the output by scaling and shifting, allowing the model to maintain useful information while preventing excessive internal covariate shifts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Encoder Block's design, with its combination of self-attention, feed-forward neural networks, skip connections, and layer normalization, enables the Vision Transformer to learn rich, hierarchical representations of the input data. This structure is repeated multiple times in the model, each block building upon the representations learned by the previous one, gradually refining the understanding of the input image.\n",

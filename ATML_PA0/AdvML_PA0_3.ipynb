    "# Assignment 0 Part 3 - CLIP and Zero-Shot Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous work, we focused solely on visual information, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers to analyze and interpret images. However, the field of machine learning has expanded to include multimodal models that integrate different types of data. This brings us to CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a groundbreaking model that combines both text and images to learn their interrelationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP, developed by OpenAI, is designed to understand and connect textual descriptions with corresponding images. Unlike traditional models that operate within a single modality, CLIP learns to map both text and images into a shared feature space. This shared space enables the model to grasp the relationship between visual content and textual descriptions, making it possible to perform tasks that involve both types of information. For example, CLIP can interpret a sentence and find the image that best matches this description or generate a textual description for a given image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to learn representations across different modalities opens up new possibilities for tasks that CLIP wasn't explicitly trained for. One of the most intriguing applications is zero-shot classification, where CLIP can classify images into categories it has never seen during training, simply based on the similarity of the image to textual descriptions of those categories. Another powerful feature is the ability to find the closest image match to a query caption, which can be particularly useful for image retrieval and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing CLIP, we move beyond single-modality tasks and explore the potential of models that understand and integrate multiple forms of information. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of our models but also expands the range of applications they can address, making them more versatile and powerful in handling complex real-world tasks.\n",

    "## Task 0. Getting our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement CLIP effectively, we need a dataset that pairs complete sentences with their corresponding images, enabling the model to learn the relationship between textual descriptions and visual content. One such dataset is Flick8k, which contains thousands of images, each paired with multiple descriptive captions. This dataset is a good fit for training models that require understanding and associating both text and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Flick8k using [this link from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that replicating the exact training process described in the original CLIP paper would require substantial computational resources. Instead, we can use a subset of the dataset for our experiments, which will allow us to explore CLIP's capabilities without the need for extensive training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CLIP architecture, we need to process both text and images through separate encoders. The Text Encoder converts input captions into embeddings, while the Image Encoder transforms images into a compatible feature space. One critical step in working with text is tokenization. Tokenization involves breaking down a sentence into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which are then converted into numerical representations that the model can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization prepares the text for embedding by splitting it into manageable pieces and mapping these pieces to unique identifiers. For example, the sentence \"A cat sitting on a mat\" might be tokenized into individual words or subword units, each of which is then converted into an embedding vector by the Text Encoder. This process allows the model to handle various lengths and structures of text inputs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating both text and image encoders into our implementation, and understanding the importance of tokenization, we can create a system that learns to relate textual descriptions to visual content accurately. This approach enables the model to perform tasks such as matching captions to images and understanding the semantic connections between different modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell(s) below, a configuration class has been defined for the hyperparameters of the model, and a `CLIPDataset` class to make working with the data less of a hassle. Take some time to understand how the tokenizer works and what one batch of data would look like."

This allows us to leverage ResNet50's powerful feature extraction while bypassing the classification layer, which is unnecessary for our purpose.\n",

    "## Task 5. Zero-shot Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for a very new type of downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot image classification is a technique where a model can correctly classify images into categories it has never seen during training. Unlike traditional classification models that require training on specific labeled examples for each category, a zero-shot model like CLIP leverages its ability to understand and relate images and text descriptions to classify new categories on the fly. This is possible because CLIP learns a joint embedding space for both images and text, allowing it to generalize to new tasks without additional training.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP achieves zero-shot classification by mapping both images and text (such as category names or descriptions) into the same embedding space. During inference, you provide the model with a set of textual descriptions of potential categories (e.g., \"a dog,\" \"a cat,\" \"a car\") and an image to classify. The model computes the similarity between the image embedding and each text embedding. The category with the highest similarity score is then chosen as the predicted label for the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to perform it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare Your Text Prompts**: Write down the categories you want to classify the image into. For example, if you're classifying an animal, your categories might be \"a dog,\" \"a cat,\" \"a bird,\" etc. Note you can include full length sentences too, it's not limited to one-word categories anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encode the Text Prompts**: Use the text encoder part of the CLIP model to convert these category descriptions into embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encode the Image**: Use the image encoder part of the CLIP model to convert the image into an embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute Similarities**: Calculate the similarity between the image embedding and each of the text embeddings. This step determines how closely the image matches each category description.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Select the Best Match**: Identify the text prompt (category) that has the highest similarity score with the image. This category is your model's prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a function that performs the zero-shot classification as described. Once you've implemented the function, test it with an image of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the model does not perform spectacularly on some sets of images and prompts, but that's alright: we trained it on a very small dataset with a very small number of steps. You can look into scaling up in your own time."

Notebooks working on deep learning models exploring topics like diffusion, evaluating inductive biases of models, deep unrolling and unfolding of iterative models into neural networks, effects of various compression techniques (pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation), different federated learning setups and effect of heterogeneity on model accuracy and finally applying different techniques of generalization to OOD data.
